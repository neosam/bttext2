License for non code material:  CC-BY-NC-SA

You are free to

 * The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license
     terms.

Under the following terms
 * Attribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the
     license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any
     reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses
     you or your use.

 * ShareAlike — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must
     distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.
 * No additional restrictions — You may not apply legal terms or technological
     measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license
     permits.


Additional notes:
Rules for dual license:
 * Sourcecode always applies to the GPL2 license:
   * The engine (bt*.ml*) files doesn't contain any story so there should
       not be any discussion which license applies to them (it's GPL2).
   * The other files defines the game play and the mechanics of the story.
       They a slightly part of the story and could also apply to the CC
       license.  But since level format, texts, trigger definition and so on
       are stored in external files and the source should only define the
       mechanics, it makes no sense to make things complicated.  This is source
       and also apply to GPL2.
 * Ascii art, level design, music, videos, texts and the story in gerneral
     only apply to CC-BY-NC-SA.
 * Commercial use is not allowed by default.  If you have other plans,
     please contact me.
 * Why this non-social, non free cultural, commercial license?
     Normally, I guess, the license of this game does not matter because
     I might not finish the game and nobody will notice it anyway.
     If I finish the game, maybe also nobody or just a few will notice it.
     But there is little, tiny chance that it becomes successful.  If it
     becomes a big movie and the only thing I get is my name in the
     credits while others get millions of dollars, I will be really pissed!
     Again,
     if you read this, I'm not megalomaniac, at least I think to.  The only
     thing I want, is to be prepared if something like that happens even if
     I don't believe in it.
