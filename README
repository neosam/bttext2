 /1\\   What is Bermuda Triangle

 A game I plan to finish for about 15 years :).


 /1.1\\  What is bttext

It is the text based engine of the game which can and will also be used for
other games.


/1.2\\  Status

The first version of the engine was written in python.  Since I don't like the
code anymore I decided to rewrite it in Ocaml.  This version has a much clearer
MVC architecture which has for example the opportunity to compile a web based
version by replacing some modules.


/1.3\\  Ingame

There is no ingame yet.  The first example game will be "Story of Lalala" which
is a stpid made up game to test the engine.


/1.4\\  License

GPLv2.  Free Software FTW!!!



/2\\  Getting started

/2.1\\  Compile

You will need the ocaml compiler and its the curses bindings to compile it.  
Then you can run ./compile.sh and you should get a ./lalala file.


/2.2\\  Run

Run ./lalala


/2.3\\  Controls

q exits the game :)
